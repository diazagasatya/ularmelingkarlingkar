	- Decision Tree Classifier

Linear Regression - ML 1/Google Stock Prediction 7/16-7/17
	- A rough prediction of Google adjusted price between July16’-17’
	- The implementation of Gradient Descent, Sum of Errors, Partial Derivative
	- Also consist the data as a cvs file

Linear Regression - ML 1/Animal Weight Predictor given Brain Weight
	- A prediction machine learner of an Animal’s weight given its brain weight
	- The implementation of Gradient Descent, Sum of Errors, Partial Derivative
	- Also consist the data as a cvs file

Linear Regression - ML 1/Global CO2 Emission Prediction 1958-2017 
	- A somewhat rough prediction of Global CO2 Emission from 1958-2017
	- The implementation of Gradient Descent, Sum of Errors, Partial Derivative
	- Also consist the data as a cvs file

Decision Tree Classifier - ML 1/Binary Classification - Male or Female? 
	- A Binary classification machine learner
	- From given data points, ML will predict output male or female
